# ML_Algorithms_Implementation_Comparison
Compares the implementation of the Pocket Algorithm and Linear Regression using Python and NumPy with their counterparts in scikit-learn. It would demonstrate the fundamental understanding of the algorithms by coding them from scratch and then evaluate the performance against the established modules in scikit-learn.
